This is my take on the Codecademy project titled "Mixed Messages".

## General Info
The goal of this project was to create a Javascript file that returns a randomly generated sentence. At least three segements of that sentence should be randomly generated, which is what I have done here. I chose the Solar System as the subject for my project. My code selects a planet, followed by a satellite of that planet, followed by a fact about that planet. These are all randomly selected, and formated into a coherent sentence.


## Technologies
* Node.js v12.14.1
* VS Code v1.52.0
* Javascript


## Side Note
Please excuse my attempts at humor. I did not realize that Mercury and Venus do not have any natural satellites until I had started researching this project. As a result some of the sentences this code returns might be slightly less than informative.



Thank you for taking the time to look at my code. Any feedback and/or constructive is always welcome and greatly appreciated.
